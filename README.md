Hello! 
My name is Alec Tokosch. I am currently in my second semester at Clemson University working towards my masters in automotive engineering. I chose to pursue my master in automotive engineering because of a project I completed in undergrad where I was the ECE lead on a SAE Formula Electric race car.
This repository will contain all of the files for AuE893 Autonomy sciences and systems, I think this should be an interesting class!
