This is assignment 2 submission
Within the src folder there are 6 files and a folder called Launch, a folder called videos, and a folder called screenshots
The launch folder contains launch files created. 

The screenshots folder contains the screen shots of the 3 tasks. 
Circle path is file circle.png
Square open loop path is file sq_openloop.png
Square closed loop path is file sq_closedloop.png

The videos folder contains two videos of the task.
Assignment2_video1 and Assignment2_video2, it is two videos since git would not allow me to upload a file greater than 100 MB. 

TO RUN:
To run each individually, use the launch files:
turtlesim_circle.launch, turtlesim_squareol.launch, turtlesim_ squarecl.launch

To run the with parameters with the launch files, use launch files:
turtlesim_circle_param.launch, turtlesim_circle_sq_param.launch

To run all with no parameters in the launch files, use launch files:
turtlesim_assign2_all.launch


EXPLAINATION OF FILES:
src folder python scripts:
circle.py – the python script for the first part of the assignment where the turtlebot will complete a circle. 
circle_param.py – the python script for the first part of the assignment where the turtlebot will complete a circle but using a launch file that passes the parameters to the script. 

square_openloop.py – the python script for the second part of the assignment where the turtlebot will complete a 2x2 circle at a specific speed.  
square_openloop_param.py – the python script for the second part of the assignment where the turtlebot will complete a 2x2 circle at a specific speed but using a launch file that passes the parameters for linear speed, angular speed, and the distance for each side of the square. 

square_closedloop.py – the python script for the third part of the assignment where the turtlebot will goes to specific points, these points are hard coded into the script. 

Extra Credit – launch files
There are 6 launch files. 
turtlesim_assign2_all.launch – launches the 3 main files for assignment 2, these files are circle.py, square_openloop.py, and square_closedloop.py.

turtlesim_circle.launch – launches the main circle file, circle.py, that has hard coded parameters (not passed using the launch files)
turtlesim_circle_param.launch – launches the circle file with parameters, circle_param.py that has the parameters coded into the launch file. 

turtlesim_circle_sp_param.launch –launches the circle file with parameters, circle_param.py, and the square openloop file, square_openloop_param.launch, that has the parameters coded into the launch file. 

turtlesim_squareol.launch – launches the main square openloop file, square_openloop.py, that has hard coded parameters (not passed using the launch files).

turtlesim_squarecl.launch – launches the main square closedloop file, square_closedloop.py, that has hard coded parameters (not passed using the launch files).
